In this home task we want to find the prime numbers before the defined number .numbers which is defined in the code
at the beginning .after that we use a loop to iterate to that number and check the numbers starting from 2 and dividing
them by the numbers before the root if that number (for making it optiml) and see if the remain of the division is 0 or not. if the remainder of 
  the division is 0 it won't be a prime number so we will continue to test. the test is defined as a point that the compiler
will go to that point and continue the iteration of the loop.

The continue gets out of the inner loop and goes to the test and
continues the outer loop. when we finish from the inner loop
and find the number that it's remainder of the the division of that number is not zero it prints out that number as a prime number and continues.
