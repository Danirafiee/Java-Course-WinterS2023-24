In home task 1 part 4 we've been asked to sort out the words that exist in the defined text 
first we define the text and put the words in an array of words by using the split method
we split the words with using the space and we use the definition of the word in which 
bwtween each word there is a space. after extracting the words from the text we go in a loop in that array

In the loop we we compare two words and if the second one should be switched with the first one we
switch them and put the variable i to -1  which makes it to go to the beginning of the loop and
the start checking the words from the beginning

After ending the loop the words are sorted alphabetically and we print them out using another loop
