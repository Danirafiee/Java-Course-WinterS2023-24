In homework 1 part 3 we are trying to count the number of spaces vowels and letters in a defined text 
first we will define the text as a string and find a spaces vowels and letters as integers to count the number
of those then we will put the vowels in a string and let all of the  alphabetic letters in the string of 
letters then we will  iterate character by character in the defined text

In the text we put each character in a temporary character variable then we compare them to space to the vowels
and to the letters and when they're the character is equal to space we increment the counter of a spaces when it
is one of the vowels we increment the number  of vowels
And when the character is a letter we increment letters counter. at the end we will print out
the results which are the number of vowels spaces and constant letters
