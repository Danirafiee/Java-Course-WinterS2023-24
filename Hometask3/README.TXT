At home work three I have to define the super class vehicle with subclasses ICV hybridV and BEV

I have defined engine as a super class and electric engine hybrid engine and combust engine as  it's subclasses

The class manufacture is the same as the class car in the previous home task and it has the same attribute and methods

The show characteristics method is defined in the vehicle class which shows the characteristics of the car which are
manufacturer and engine in the manufacturer we have the attributes of the car and in the engine we have the engine type.

In the main program I have defined an array of vehicles and initialised them with the subclasses(ICV,HybridV and BEV) as empty objects of manufacture and different types of engines

There is a data array which is an array of objects which has the different information about cars after that there is a loop that iterates
over the vehicle array and extracts the data from data array and sets them to the objects of the vehicles


Then there is a loop which goes over the area of vehicles and shows the characteristics by using the show characteristics methods
