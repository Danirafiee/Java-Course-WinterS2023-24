In task 2 I define a class car the class car has the asked attributes

We define the constructor of the car and define methods to get the attributes

In the main I have defined an array of cars with different attributes after that
I define the sorting keywords for example for the first order which sorts the cars
by  brand we have a variable brand sorter for the second sorter we
have model sort and age sorter and for the third one we have year sorter and price sorter

I have used the file writer class to create text files with the defined names after
that the program reads in the array of the cara and checks if the conditions are 
satisfied for each sorting file and writes that car with its information to the defined file

For changing the sorting variables you should change the mentioned variables and run the main program again
